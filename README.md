## Investigation on deep learning boosted Markowitz model
The Markowitz model, one of the best-known portfolio construction models, takes into account an
important assumption: future returns on assets are known based on recent past returns.
This paper evaluates the possibility of using complex deep learning structures to estimate asset
correlation and therefore asset covariance, one of the inputs that feed the Markowitz model, to reduce
the impact of this initial assumption.
